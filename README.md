Coursera Course - Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This repository contains my work from a Coursera course on basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I completed in May 2025. The course introduced core front-end web development concepts and gave me hands-on experience building simple web pages and interactive elements.
